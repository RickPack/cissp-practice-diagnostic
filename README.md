# CISSP Practice Diagnostic

> **Unofficial practice tool. Not affiliated with or endorsed by ISC2. CISSP is a registered mark of ISC2.**

A free, static practice exam that draws up to 100 random questions from an original question bank, then produces a diagnostic report of strengths and weaknesses across the eight CISSP domains, with a review of every missed question.

**Live site:** https://rickpack.github.io/cissp-practice-diagnostic/

Results are for study planning only. They do not predict your result on the real exam.

## What it does

- **Session length** from 20 to min(100, bank size), drawn by a stratified random sample that follows the 2024 domain weights and a 30/45/25 easy/medium/hard mix. If a domain or difficulty runs short, the sampler takes what exists and redistributes the rest.
- **Option order is shuffled** per question, and sessions are reproducible with an optional seed.
- **One question at a time**, with previous/next, flag for review, a progress bar, keyboard shortcuts (`1`–`4` or `A`–`D`, arrow keys, `F`), and no feedback until the end.
- **Submit and Finish** unlocks after 20 answers. Unanswered questions are excluded from scoring and listed separately.
- **Progress is saved** in your browser (localStorage), so a refresh does not lose your place. Nothing is sent anywhere; there is no backend.
- **Works offline** after the first visit.

### The diagnostic report

- Raw score, a difficulty-weighted score (easy 1, medium 1.5, hard 2), and an exam-weight-adjusted score.
- A per-domain table with answered count, percent correct, a Wilson 95% confidence interval, and difficulty-weighted percent.
- Each domain is classified by comparing its interval to a 70% study target:
  - **Strength**: the whole interval is at or above 70%.
  - **Weakness**: the whole interval is below 70%.
  - **Adequate**: the interval crosses 70%.
  - **Insufficient data**: fewer than 4 questions answered in the domain. Never labeled a strength or weakness.
- Charts of percent correct by domain (with interval whiskers and the target line) and by difficulty.
- Study guidance for each Weakness domain: missed subtopics, concrete focus areas, and concepts to review.
- A review of missed and flagged questions, filterable by domain and difficulty, showing your answer, the correct answer, the explanation, and why each distractor is wrong.
- JSON export, a print-friendly layout, and a "Retake focusing on weak domains" option that draws about 60% of the next session from Weakness domains.

## Run locally

The site is plain HTML, CSS, and JavaScript with no build step. It uses ES modules, so serve it over HTTP instead of opening the file directly:

```sh
python -m http.server 8000
# then open http://localhost:8000
```

### Tests

```sh
npm test                                            # JS unit tests (Node 20+, no dependencies)
python -m pip install -r validation/requirements.txt
python validation/validate.py                       # bank validator; writes validation/report.md
```

Unit tests cover sampling proportions and graceful degradation, answer remapping after shuffling, the 20-answer gate, scoring, and the Wilson interval math. They run against synthetic banks of 80, 250, and 1,000 questions, plus a 1,000-session simulation that checks per-domain draw proportions stay within ±3 points of the targets.

## Question bank

The bank lives in `data/`:

| File | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `data/schema.json` | JSON Schema for a batch file (an array of questions) |
| `data/taxonomy.json` | Domain names, exam weights, v1.0 targets, difficulty mix, and the controlled subtopic list with study focus areas |
| `data/manifest.json` | Bank version and the list of batch files the app loads |
| `data/batches/D{n}_{k}.json` | Batch files, at most 50 questions each |

Every question is original. None are reproduced or paraphrased from ISC2 materials, official study guides, or commercial question banks. Scenarios use generic fictional organizations only.

Each question has an `id` (for example `D3-0042`), `domain`, `domain_name`, `subtopic` (from the taxonomy), `difficulty`, `type` (`knowledge`, `application`, or `managerial_best_first_most`), `stem`, `options` A–D, `answer`, `explanation`, `distractor_rationales` for the three wrong letters, `references_topic` (a concept name), and `version`.

### Add and validate a batch

1. Write the new file, for example `data/batches/D4_3.json`, following `data/schema.json`. Use the next unused IDs for that domain and subtopics listed in `data/taxonomy.json`.
2. Stage-check it before listing it: `python validation/validate.py --include data/batches/D4_3.json`
3. Fix every hard failure. Hard failures are schema errors, duplicate IDs, manifest mismatches, all/none-of-the-above options, rationale letters that don't match the key, unknown subtopics, and near-duplicate stems (TF-IDF cosine above 0.85).
4. Review the warnings in `validation/report.md`: answer-letter balance (20–30% per letter once the bank has 200+ questions), how often the correct answer is the longest option (limit 35%), and the managerial-question share (target 35%+).
5. Add the file to `data/manifest.json` with its `domain` and `count`, bump `bank_version`, re-run the validator, and commit the batch, manifest, and report together. No code changes are needed.

### Independent answer-key audit (Colab)

`validation/validate_bank.ipynb` runs the same validator in Google Colab and adds an optional audit: a Claude model answers each question **without** seeing the key, explanation, or rationales. Items where the model disagrees with the key, answers with low confidence, thinks another option is also defensible, or notes a flaw in the item are written to `validation/flags.csv` for human review.

1. Open the notebook in Colab: https://colab.research.google.com/github/RickPack/cissp-practice-diagnostic/blob/main/validation/validate_bank.ipynb
2. Add your Anthropic API key in **Colab Secrets** (key icon) as `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` and allow notebook access. Never paste the key into a cell or commit it.
3. Set `MODEL` (default `claude-sonnet-5`), `TARGET` (`"all"` or one batch file), and `MODE` (`"batch"` is half price and asynchronous; `"sync"` is immediate and resumable). Try `LIMIT = 5` first.
4. Run all cells, download `flags.csv`, and copy it into `validation/`.
5. For each flagged row, correct or replace the question and record what you did in the `resolution` column. Re-run the validator and commit.

The same audit runs locally with `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` set in your environment: `python validation/audit.py --target data/batches/D4_3.json` (install `validation/requirements-audit.txt` first).

## Continuous integration

Every push runs the bank validator and the unit tests. Pushes to `main` that pass both are deployed to GitHub Pages. Workflow actions are pinned to full commit SHAs, and Python dependencies are pinned to exact versions.
